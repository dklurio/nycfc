			<h2>History</h2>

			<h3 id="foundation">Foundation</h3>

			<p>MLS had an interest in placing a second team in the New York area as early as <time>2006</time>, when the <i class="team name">MetroStars</i>' exclusive territorial rights reverted to the league as a condition of the club's sale to <b class=brand>Red Bull GmbH</b>. By the following year, the league had held talks with several groups, including <i>New York Mets</i> owner Fred Wilpon and his family, about owning the second New York club.The Wilpons' interest in MLS reportedly faded following the family's losses in the <i class=event>Madoff investment scandal</i>, but the league continued to look for investors.</p>

			<p>In <time>2010</time>, MLS commissioner <b class=person>Don Garber</b> officially announced the league's intent to make its 20th franchise a second team in the New York area. At that point, the league hoped to have the new team beginning operations by <time>2013</time>. Garber also held discussions with the owners of the rebooted <i class="team name">New York Cosmos</b>, but they balked at the league's expansion fee and single-entity structure and decided not to apply for entry, instead joining the second-tier <b class=brand>North American Soccer League</b>.</p>

			<p>Garber had previously cultivated an interest in acquiring investment from a major European soccer club to be owners of a future franchise, and in <time>December 2008</time>, he announced a bid for a Miami expansion team led by <i class="team name">FC Barcelona</i> that was to begin play in <time>2010</time> if accepted,though the bid eventually fell through (Garber also briefly discussed Barcelona investing in a New York franchise before moving the focus to Miami).</p>

			<p>But when Ferran Soriano, Barcelona's vice president at the time of the Miami bid, was appointed Manchester City CEO in <time>August 2012</time>, Garber reached out to him about a New York City team. In <time>December 2012</time>, unnamed sources told the media that Manchester City were close to being announced as the new owners of the 20th team of MLS, and the brand name "New York City Football Club" was trademarked, although the club quickly denied the report. However, Garber announced in <time>March 2013</time> that he was almost ready to unveil the new expansion team.</p>

 			<p><i class="team name">Manchester City</i> and the <i class="team name">New York Yankees</i> baseball team paid a $100 million expansion fee to join the league.</p>

			<p>New York City Football Club, LLC was registered with the New York State Department on <time datetime="2013-05-07">May 7, 2013</time>, and on <time>May 21</time> the team was officially announced as the 20th Major League Soccer franchise.</p>


			<p>Former <i class="team name">Manchester City</i> midfielder and U.S. international Claudio Reyna was named as the first director of the club.</p>
		
			<p>On <time datetime="2013-05-22">May 22, 2013</time>, the club named former United States and Manchester City midfielder Claudio Reyna as its director of football operations, responsible for coaching staff and player recruitment ahead of the team's inaugural MLS season in 2015. Reyna, a New Jersey native, also played for the nearby <i class="team name">New York Red Bulls</i>. He said he had begun identifying candidates to be the club's head coach, but would not name one in <time>2013</time>. The team announced an English-language radio deal with WFAN on <time datetime="2013-10-03">October 3, 2013</time>.</p>

			<p>The club made their first recruitment dealing in off-field matters on <time datetime="2013-09-06">September 6, 2013</time>, when they hired former <i class="team name">Rutgers University</i> Athletic Director <b class=name>Tim Pernetti</b> to serve as Chief Business Officer, part of a five-year deal with the university. Further hirings were made in mid-<time>November</time>, when three experienced administrators were appointed to Vice President roles.</p>

			<p><time datetime="2013-12-11">On December 11, 2013</time>, <b class=name>Jason Kreis</b> was announced as the first head coach of the new franchise, having reached the end of his contract at <i class="team name">Real Salt Lake</i> and declined an extension. The move came just four days after he missed out on lifting his second MLS Cup with the Utah team, losing on penalties to <i class="team name">Sporting Kansas City</i>. It was revealed in the announcement that his contract, starting on <time datetime="2014-01-01">January 1, 2014</time>, would see him begin by travelling to Manchester in England to familiarize himself with the set-up of franchise-owners Manchester City. Kreis' official unveiling was made at a press conference on <time datetime="2014-01-10">January 10, 2014</time>, where he made it public that his former assistant <b class=name>Miles Joseph</b> had joined him at the club.</p>

			<p>On <time>June 2, 2014</time> the club announced that Spanish World Cup-winning striker <b class=person>David Villa</b> had signed as the first player. While the team awaited its MLS start in 2015, Villa was loaned to another team owned by Manchester City, <i class="team name">Melbourne City FC</i> of the Australian A-League but was called back after only four matches. On <time datetime="2014-06-24">July 24, 2014</time>, New York City FC announced at a live press conference in Brooklyn that ex-England international and Chelsea all-time top goal scorer <b class=name>Frank Lampard</b> would be joining them as their second Designated Player. Reyna hailed Lampard as "one of the greatest players in world history." Lampard said that "It is a privilege to be able to help make history here in New York City." On <time datetime="2015-07-06">July 6, 2015</time> the club signed Italian international <b class=name>Andrea Pirlo</b> from Juventus as their third Designated Player.</p>

			<p>In the <time>2015</time> MLS SuperDraft, as an expansion team, New York City had second overall pick, choosing <i class="team name">Oregon State</i> forward <b class=name>Khiry Shelton</b> as their first pick.</p>

			<h3>Inaugural season</h3>

			<p>An up-and-down pre-season saw them dominate their first ever exhibition match, played against Scotland's <i class-"team name">St Mirren</i>, with Villa scoring the club's first ever goal in a regulated match, while in the Carolina Challenge Cup, they finished second out of four teams after a slow start ruled out their chances of picking up the non-competitive silverware. Their first ever league game was played on <time>March 8</time> against fellow expansion side <i class="team name">Orlando City</i>, with <b class=name>Mix Diskerud</b> scoring their first ever competitive goal in a game which finished 1â€“1 in front of a packed Citrus Bowl stadium. A week later in their first home game, Villa and <b class=name>Patrick Mullins</b> scored in their first home win against <i class="team name">New England Revolution</i> in front of a crowd of 43,507. The team eventually suffered an eleven-game winless streak which ended on <time>June 16</time>, after defeating the <i class="team name">Philadelphia Union</i> 2-1.</p>

		<p>New York faced the New York Cosmos in the fourth round of the <time>2015</time> Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, and were eliminated on penalties after playing overtime. The team finished 8th in the Eastern Conference, 17th overall. After the season ended, Kreis was relieved from his head coaching duties on November 2. The team's failure to make the playoffs and the team's second lowest points in the league, were the main factors in his release. A week later, <b class=name>Patrick Vieira</b> was announced as the new head coach of the team.</p>
